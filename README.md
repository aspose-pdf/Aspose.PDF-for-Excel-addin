### Create Trusted Add-in Catalogs using Shared folders / Windows 11

1. Share a folder:
    1. In `File Explorer`, go to the parent folder, or drive letter, of the folder you want to use as your shared folder catalog.
    2. Open the context menu for the folder you want to use as your shared folder catalog (for example, right-click the folder) and choose `Properties`.
    3. In the `Properties` dialog window, open the `Sharing` tab and choose the `Share` button.
    4. Within the `Network access` dialog window, add yourself and any other users and/or groups with whom you want to share your add-in. The folder must have at least `Read/Write` permission. After choosing people to share with, choose the `Share` button.
    5. When you see the `Your folder is shared` confirmation, note the full network path displayed immediately following the folder name. (You'll need to enter this value as the Catalog Url when you specify the shared folder as a trusted catalog, as described in the next section of this article.) Choose the `Done` button to close the `Network Access` dialog window.
    6. Choose the `Close` button to close the `Properties` dialog window.
    7. Put the manifest XML file (the one you have edited and saved) into the shared folder.

2. Specify the shared folder as a trusted catalog:
    1. Open a new document in Excel.
    2. Choose the `File` tab, and then choose `Options`.
    3. Choose `Trust Center` and then the `Trust Center Settings` button.

    4. Choose `Trusted Add-in Catalogs`.
    5. In the `Catalog Url` box, enter the full network path to the folder that you shared previously. If you failed to note the folder's full network path when you shared the folder, you can get it from the folder's Properties dialog window.
    6. After entering the folder's full network path into the `Catalog Url` box, choose the `Add catalog button`.
    7. Select the `Show in Menu` check box for the newly added item, and then click the `OK` button to close the Trust Center dialog window.
